========

Implementing an admin application to manage deployment in the style of http://www.12factor.net/


## The Twelve Factors

### I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

### II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

### III. Config
Store config in the environment

### IV. Backing Services
Treat backing services as attached resources

### V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages

### VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

### VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding

### VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model

### IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

### X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

### XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams

### XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
